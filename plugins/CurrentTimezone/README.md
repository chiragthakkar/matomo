# Current Local Time in Website's Timezone

#### This Matomo plugin displays the current time in the timezone of the website being tracked. This is particularly useful when the website is in a different timezone than the user, as it allows users to quickly see the current time on the website without having to manually calculate the time difference.
#### For example, if the website is configured to be in New York, but the user is located in Los Angeles, the plugin will display the current time in New York.

### To run tests
```./console tests:run CurrentTimezone```
